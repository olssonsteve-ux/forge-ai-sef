# Project State

## Status

Forge 0.2 MVP implementation stage.

## Current Version

`0.2.0`

## Current Objective

Implement the first MVP CLI command: `forge init <project-name>`.

## What Exists

- repository structure
- project purpose
- project vision
- architecture proposal
- initial architectural decisions
- roadmap from `0.1` to `1.0`
- project memory documents
- AI handoff document
- Milestone 0 architecture review record
- documentation authority map
- accepted project memory schemas
- ADR lifecycle and status rules
- standard categories and acceptance criteria
- template ownership, versioning, and change rules
- pre-implementation specification for `forge init <project-name>`
- bootstrap template system contract
- versioned bootstrap template directory
- initial bootstrap templates with metadata and variables
- Forge Capability Specification directory
- FCS-001 Review Capability specification
- ADR for Forge Capability Specifications
- Python package configuration
- Typer-based CLI entrypoint
- implemented `forge init <project-name>`
- template loading and validation
- bootstrap rendering from `templates/bootstrap/`
- dry-run mode
- conservative overwrite protection
- automated tests for the first CLI command

## What Does Not Exist

- release automation
- accepted release standard
- template migration tooling
- implemented review command
- review report template
- automated review scoring
- plugin system
- project profiles beyond bootstrap

## Architectural Posture

Forge should be documentation-led first, then contract-led, then implementation-led.

Implementation should only begin after the core framework concepts are explicit enough to test and review.

Milestone 0 adds an explicit architecture review gate before implementation work. Architecture review findings should be recorded under `docs/architecture/`, and durable governance decisions should be recorded as ADRs.

Forge 0.1 RC1 is accepted as the architecture foundation. Pre-implementation hardening defines contracts for project memory, ADRs, standards, templates, and the first CLI command without writing production code.

The final architecture milestone defines Forge as template-driven. `forge init <project-name>` must render versioned templates from `templates/bootstrap/` and must not hardcode generated file contents.

Forge now evolves permanent capabilities through Forge Capability Specifications under `docs/capabilities/`. FCS-001 defines how Forge performs project reviews before any review command is implemented.

Forge 0.2 introduces the first implementation layer. `forge init <project-name>` is intentionally narrow: it renders bootstrap templates, creates the default folder structure, supports dry-run, validates project names, and refuses to overwrite non-empty directories.

## Next Recommended Work

1. Review Forge 0.2 MVP implementation.
2. Decide whether to commit the CLI implementation.
3. Define release standard and release checklist.
4. Specify review report persistence before implementing `forge review`.
5. Keep plugins, project profiles, and migration tooling out of scope until separately specified.
